Title: Benefits for Banks
Description: Celloscope’s Banking Platform helps banks increase service penetration, enhance customer loyalty and stickiness, reduce cost of operations and increase revenue. With mobile banking, banks can empower its customers (directly or through agents) to securely access their bank accounts using mobile phones to get information of their accounts like available balance, transactions summary etc. They can also make transactions in real time. Celloscope Banking platform facilitates banks to reach all potential customers, banked and unbanked across geographies in a very speedy and cost effective manner.
Celloscope Banking Platform incorporates input from bankers, technologists and end users. We, the organizations and people behind Celloscope, are very much aligned with the identification of bankers and regulators of Bangladesh that the current banking facilities coverage in Bangladesh is skewed in many senses – institutional banking covers only a meagre portion of people of Bangladesh and the platforms and technology that are being used in extending the coverage have inherent technological, economic and social limitations – they are fragmented, not optimized in the sense of cost in Bangladesh perspective and we do not own them or can control. them.
