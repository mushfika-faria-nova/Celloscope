Description: With degrees in engineering and having spent most of their professional years in and around technologies, they can easily be labeled as an assembly of typical nerdsand geeks. Surprisingly, this crowd does not fall into that stereotyped category; they still listen to their music, search the night sky for falling stars, and read their fictions.This attribute, above all, gives them the edge over their competitors. They can think outside the realm of technology and relate easily to the need of their clients. This quality coupled with their command over technology gives CELLOSCOPE its unique flavor.
