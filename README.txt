#How to run it:

You must have an local server installed on your pc (apachee, XAMPP etc,).i have used XAMPP for local server.

After installing XAMPP, go to XAMPP control panel, click on ‘Start’ under ‘Actions’ for the Apache module. This instructs XAMPP to start the Apache webserver.

Save this files in c:\xampp\htdocs\ (or whichever directory you installed XAMPP in).

Navigate to http://localhost/index.html or 127.0.0.1. You should see the website.
